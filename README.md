# BogusPlugin
This is a bogus plugin. IDK why I made it. Maybe because I'm bogus and so are you.

**Function**
This is Minecraft, but everytime you break a block, a hostile mob spawns. There is even a chance to spawn the Wither, albeit way less than the chances to spawn any other mob. Also, there is a 10% chance to spawn a duplicate of such mob if you hit it with anything but an open fist.

**Commands**
/bogus:
The syntax for this is: /bogus <any_mob> <any_other_mob> ... This will override the normal function and cause the plugin to randomly choose from a mob listed to spawn when a block is broken.

/nobogus:
Reverses /bogus.
